\section{Introduction}

\section{Background}

\subsection{Kink Oscillations}
~\cite{kink_1} investigated evidence of kink oscillations
with data from TRACE.
~\cite{kink_2} investigated the distributions of the damping
of kink oscillations.

\subsection{Sausage Oscillations}


\section{Data}
As part of the general topic of coronal seismology,
a small research project was carried out as well, continuing
over from several semesters previously.

\section{Analysis}

\section{Conclusion}
And we're finished.
