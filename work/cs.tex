\section*{A}

\paragraph{acoustic waves}
\begin{itemize*}
    \item Longitudinal
    \item propagate by means of adiabatic compression and decompression
    \item travel at sound speed (determined by medium)
    \item Important quantities:
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item sound pressure
            \item particle velocity
            \item particle displacement
            \item sound intensity
        \end{itemize*}
    \item exist because of a pressure restoring force: local compression
        (or rarefaction) sets up a \emph{pressure gradient} in opposition
        to the motion
    \item carry energy away from source
    \item large enough amplitude $\rightarrow$ shock wave,
        but usually small; ambient gas slightly disturbed
    \item exist in medium with low or non-existent magnetic field
    \item isotropic
\end{itemize*}

\paragraph{Alfv\'en waves}
\begin{itemize*}
    \item transverse
    \item torsional
    \item incompressible
\end{itemize*}

\section*{B}

\paragraph{ballooning modes}
\begin{itemize*}
    \item m > 1
    \item Role not established yet
\end{itemize*}

\paragraph{body modes}

\section*{C}

\begin{itemize*}
    \item Main observational feature of the magnetic structure in the
        upper solar atmosphere.
\end{itemize*}

\section*{D}

\paragraph{dispersion relations}
\begin{itemize*}
    \item Relates the wavelength (or wavenumber) of a wave to its
        frequency.
    \item Describe the effect of dispersion in a medium on the properties
        of a wave traveling through that medium.
\end{itemize*}

\section*{E}

    \item highly dispersive.
    \item Kink modes
    \item Sausage modes
    \item propagate faster than both $V_A$ and $C_s$
\end{itemize*}

\section*{G}

\paragraph{gravity waves}
Generated in fluid medium or interface between two media when the
force of gravity or buoyency tries to restore equilibrium
e.g.\ ``wind waves'' from between atmosphere and ocean.
P-modes are global acoustic oscillations.
(Note: \emph{gravitational} waves are not the same thing; they
have something to do with relativity).

\paragraph{group velocity}

\paragraph{gyrosynchrotron radiation}
Electromagnetic emission emitted by mildly relativistic electrons moving
in a magnetic field
(as opposed to synchrotron, with \emph{ultra}relativistic particles).

\section*{H}
\section*{I}
\section*{J}
\section*{K}

\paragraph{kink modes/waves/oscillations}
\textcolor{magenta}{(from wikipedia:)}
Kink (or transverse) modes,
are oblique (inclined with respect to the flow direction)
fast magnetoacoustic
(also known as magnetosonic waves) guided by the plasma structure;
the mode \emph{causes the displacement of the axis of the plasma structure}.
These modes are \emph{weakly compressible}, but could nevertheless be
observed with imaging instruments as \emph{periodic standing}
or \emph{propagating} displacements of coronal structures, e.g.\ coronal loops.
The frequency of transverse or ``kink'' modes is given by the following expression:
    $$ w_K = \sqrt{ \frac{2k_zB^2}{\mu(\rho_i+\rho_e)}  }   $$
In a cylindrical model of a loop,
the parameter \emph{azimuthal wave number},
m, is equal to 1 for kink modes.
This means that the cylinder is ``swaying with fixed ends''$\ldots$?

In the long wavelength limit, the phase speed of all but
sausage fast modes tends to the so-called kink speed,
which corresponds to the density weighed average Alfv\'en speed.

\section*{L}

\paragraph{leaky modes}
\begin{itemize*}
    \item Waves are allowed to radiate into the external medium,
        i.e.\ the condition of mode localization is relaxed.
    \item Bessel functions are replaced by Hankel functions in the
        dispersion relation. Can be the fundamental harmonic.
    \item Wavenumbers below cutoff value?
    \item Has electric field that decays monotonically for a finite
        distance in the transverse direction but becomes oscillatory
        everywhere beyond that finite distance.
    \item Mode ``leaks'' out of
        the waveguide as it travels down it, producing attenuation.
    \item Relative amplitude of oscillatory part (leakage rate)
        must be sufficiently small that the mode maintains its
        shape as it decays, in order to be called a mode at all.
\end{itemize*}

\paragraph{longitudinal waves}
waves in which the displacement of the \emph{medium} is in the
same direction as, or the opposite direction to,
the direction of travel of the wave.

\section*{M}
\paragraph{magnetoacoustic waves}
A magnetosonic wave (also magnetoacoustic wave) is a longitudinal wave
of ions (and electrons) in a magnetized plasma propagating perpendicular
to the stationary magnetic field.
Magnetoacoustic modes are collectively supported by the plasma
environment., i.e., the wave mode acts across neighbouring magnetic field
lines and across transverse plasma inhomogeneities.

\paragraph{magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves}
\begin{itemize*}
    \item Dissipation of MHD waves is manifold:
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Couple with each other
            \item interact non-linearly
            \item resonantly interact with the closed waveguide
            \item devolop non-linearly (e.g.\ solitons or shock waves
                can form)
        \end{itemize*}
    \item Inhomogeneous and magnetized plasma has two particular
        \emph{dissipation} mechanisms of MHD waves:
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Resonant absorption
            \item Phase mixing
        \end{itemize*}
\end{itemize*}


\paragraph{modes}
A wave may be a superposition of lots of other waves. Each of those
waves is a ``mode'' of the resultant wave (think of the foundation
of Fourier Analysis: sums of sines and cosines).
Modes with the lowest wave number are \emph{global}, or
\emph{fundamental} modes.

\paragraph{Moreton wave}
Chromospheric signature of a large-scale coronal shock wave. Generated
by flares, $\sim$ fast-mode MHD waves.

\section*{N}
\paragraph{Normal modes}
Vibrational state of an oscillatory \emph{system} where the frequency
is the same for all elements. E.g.\ resonant frequencies: equally
spaced multiples of the fundamental.

\section*{O}
\paragraph{oscillations}
Three types:
\begin{enumerate*}
    \item un-damped
    \item damped
    \item forced
\end{enumerate*}

\section*{P}

\paragraph{phase mixing}
\begin{itemize*}
    \item Large gradients in Alfv\'en velocity.
    \item Alfv\'en waves suffer intense phase mixing
    \item Cause decay of Alfv\'en waves.
    \item \emph{Not} likely to operate in closed magnetic structures
        (e.g.\ coronal loops)
\end{itemize*}

\paragraph{Phase speed}
$$ v_p = \frac{\lambda}{T} = \frac{\omega}{k} $$
$$ k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}, \omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} $$

\paragraph{polarization}
\begin{itemize*}
    \item Doesn't apply to longitudinal waves, e.g.\ sound.
    \item Linear waves oscillate (transversely) in a single direction.
\end{itemize*}

\paragraph{pressure waves}
This is what pressure waves are $\ldots$

\section*{R}
\paragraph{resonant absorption}
Mechanism of wave heating that could damp kink mode oscillations.
Loss of acoustic power in sunspots. Time scales:
\begin{enumerate*}
    \item damping: collective mode $\rightarrow$ local mode,
        \emph{independent} of dissipation.
    \item dissipative damping of small scale perturbations of local
        mode.
\end{enumerate*}
$\tau_1 \ll \tau_2$

\section*{S}
\paragraph{sausage modes}
\begin{itemize*}
    \item m = 0
    \item The fast magnetoacoustic sausage mode is another type of
        localized, modified fast magnetoacoustic wave.
    \item Mainly transverse.
    \item Standing fast sausage modes have symmetric tube modes
    \item Has a long-wavelength cutoff (trapped sausage modes do
        not exist at longer wavelengths).
        Approaches a cut-off at the external Alfv\'en speed.
    \item Main feature is the periodic fluctuation of the cross-sectional
        area of the waveguide. This change is also associated with
        periodic fluctuations in density and temperature within the
        waveguide.
    \item Distinct sign of sausage oscillations is when periodic
        phenomena in cross-section and intensity are almost
        180$^{\circ}$ out of phase $\rightarrow$ strong signal.
        (Less distinct signal is when periodicities in pore size
        don't match any intensity variations).
    \item Produce perturbations in density and magnetic field strength,
        and the corresponding plasma motions cause pulsations in the
        tube cross-section.
    \item Associated with perturbations of the loop cross-section
        and plasma concentration.
    \item Perturbations of plasma in the radial direction are stronger
        than perturbations along the field.
    \item Mode conversion and absorption through Alfv\'en resonance
        cannot take place (slow resonance can still operate).
    \item Phase speed is in the range between the Alfv\'en speed inside
        and outside the loop.
\end{itemize*}

\paragraph{speeds}
Characteristic speeds of MHD are the sound speed and Alfv\'enic speed,
given by:
$ C_s = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma p_0}{\rho_0}} $ and
$ C_A = \frac{B_0}{\sqrt{\mu_0\rho_0}} $


\paragraph{slow waves}
\begin{itemize*}
    \item $C_{T_0} < C_{slow} < C_{s_0}$
    \item longitudinal
    \item acoustic(?)
    \item propagate slower than both $V_A$ and $C_s$
\end{itemize*}

\paragraph{surface modes}
evanescent behavior in both media (inside and outside cylinder).


\section*{T}

\paragraph{torsional vibration}
\begin{itemize*}
    \item angular vibration of an object $\sim$ shaft along the
        axis of vibration
\end{itemize*}

\paragraph{transverse waves}
\textcolor{magenta}{(from wikipedia:)}
moving waves that \emph{consist} of oscillations occurring perpendicular
to the direction of energy transfer.
If a \emph{transverse} wave is moving in the positive x-direction,
its \emph{oscillations} are in up and down directions that lie in the y–z plane.
Light is an example of a transverse wave.
($\vec B$ and $\vec E$ oscillate in directions perpendicular to the direction
in which the light is actually traveling).
With regard to transverse waves in matter,
the \emph{displacement of the medium} is perpendicular to the
direction of propagation of the wave.
Examples: A ripple in a pond and a wave on a string.

\paragraph{trapped modes}
For a specified geometry, uniqueness of the solution to a forcing problem
at a particular frequency is equivalent to the non-existence of a trapped
mode at that frequency. A trapped mode is a solution of the corresponding
homogeneous problem and represents a free oscillation with finite energy
of the fluid surrounding the fixed structure. For a given structure,
trapped modes may exist only at discrete frequencies.
Mathematically, a trapped mode corresponds to an eigenvalue embedded
in the continuous spectrum of the relevant operator.
