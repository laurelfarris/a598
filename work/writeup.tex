\begin{abstract}
Coronal seismology involves the investigation of magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) waves and
ocillatory phenomenae that arise in the solar corona. Here some of the
dominant waves, oscillations, and modes are intimately investigated in
the literature. Analysis of data from the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA) instrument on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is
also presented, both as stand-alone research and in the broader
context of coronal seismology.

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
The heating of the corona by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
waves is one of two prevalent theories
on how it reaches such high temperatures, the other being magnetic
reconnection (\cite{acoustic_1}).

The basic types of MHD waves and oscillations are discussed in
\S\ref{MHD}.
\S\ref{topics} discusses each of the research topics in detail,
including including references to work that has been done and is
currently being carried out to address each one.
\S\ref{data} and \S\ref{analysis}
include a description of the research project and
its implications for the broader field of coronal seismology.
Conclusions and future work are summed up in
\S\ref{conclusion}.

\section{General MHD}\label{MHD}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{Types of Waves}
The categories of MHD waves and oscillations can be best understood
by their relative speeds. Figure~\ref{speeds} shows the wave speeds relative
to the internal and external Alfv\'en and sound speeds.

\subsection{Equations and Models}
MHD waves are often modeled with a cylindrical flux tube embedded
in a magnetic field.

[cylindrical model, equations of ideal MHD, etc.]
$$ \xi(x) = \xi(r)e^{i(kx+m\phi)} $$
For kink oscillations, m=1, and for sausage modes, m=0.

There are several equations for ideal MHD from which the dispersion
relations are derived (I think).

\section{Research Topics}\label{topics}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{Kink Oscillations}
Kink oscillations are directly observed in coronal loops in extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths.
They characterize the spacial oscillations that occur over the surface of
the loop, perpendicular to the direction traversed by the length
of the loop (\cite{Nak}).
Kink oscillations occur in the ``long-wavelength regime'';
the product of the wavenumber and the cross-section of the coronal
loop is much less than 1 ($ka \ll 1$). The phase speed is just above
the Alfv\'en speed within the loop, and the period of the oscillation
is expected to be between $\sim$ 2 and 20 minutes
(\cite{Asc}).

While temporal variations have been observed previously,
spatial variations were not revealed until the launch of
TRACE\@.
Some of the first observations of these spatial variations
were carried out by~\cite{kink_1},
utilizing preliminary data released from the TRACE mission
to investigate the oscillations present in coronal loops.
Using 171 \AA{} data, they modeled five loops
that occompanied a solar flare in 1998.
The resulting model had several qualities characteristic of
fast kink modes, including asymmetry and
displacements represented by sine curves.
As the period of kink modes were already known to correlate
with the magnetic field strength of the loop, pinpointing this
type of mode as the driver in coronal loops provided a valuable
constraint on coronal conditions.
The absense of any phase
shift along the length of the loops revealed that these were
\emph{standing waves}, with nodes located at the loop footpoints.

%----paper2----%
More recently,~\cite{kink_2} investigated the driving mechanism
behind the production, and damping of kink oscillations.
They compared two possible functional form of the damping profile
of the driver: that of a Gaussian and an exponential form.
While the noise level of the data was too high to distinguish
between the two forms, the simulations followed the form of a
Gaussian.

They also considered the effect of the spatial profile of the driver
itself on the excitation and subsequent damping of the kink
waves. Two different possiblilities were explored here:
the effect of a ``highly structured'' driver, which they
found to be unrealistic, and the effects of eddies and photospheric
motions around the footpoints of the coronal loops.

\subsection{Sausage Oscillations}
\cite{sausage_1} plotted the changes in intensity and cross-sectional
area for sausage oscillations in photospheric pores extending up
through the solar atmosphere. They used the general cylinder model for
the pores, though it is more likely that the cross-sectional area of
the waveguide increases with height as the temperature increases and
density drops. The relationship between pore size and intensity can
indicate

\subsection{Magnetoacoustic Waves}
Magneto-acoustic waves can be divided into two categories:
slow-mode and fast-mode (\cite{Asc}).
The slow-mode waves have phase speeds roughly equal to the sound speed
in the medium in which they reside, so these are general acoustic, or
sound waves.

Fast-mode magnetoacoustic waves have phase speeds close to the Alfv\'en
speed.



\subsection{Acoustic Oscillations}

The relatives periodicities of aacoustic oscillations were recognized
as important characteristics, and modelled by~\cite{acoustic_1}.
They recognized magnetoacoustic oscillations as a useful way to determine
other properties of the solar atmosphere.

\cite{acoustic_2} used intensity oscillations of a few different ionization
species to pinpoint the orgin and progression of magnetoacoustic waves
between bright points in the photosphere, through the transition regions,
and up into the corona. The time series of intensity oscillations was
converted into a power spectrum, and periodicities were extracted using
wavelet analysis and periodograms (note here on what exactly these are?).
The periods they derived
($\sim$ 263 +/- 80 s for the He II 256.32 \AA{} emission line and
($\sim$ 241 +/- 60 s for the Fe XII 195.12 \AA{}  emission line)
were close to the 5-minute global oscillations of the sun.


\subsection{Propagating Acoustic Waves}
While standing acoustic waves are primarily seen in closed coronal
loops, propagating waves are seen in both closed and open structures.
Their propagation speed is much lower than the local Alfv\'en speed,
so they are categorized as slow, longitudinal waves (acoustic waves,
essentially) that travel along magnetic field lines at speeds equal to
the local sound speed.
Since this speed is proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature,
which is unchanging along the length of a coronal loop, measurement of the
propagation speed could potentially provide a method of constraining the
temperature, though unfortunately this technique currently suffers from
projection effects
(\cite{Nak}).

and analytical methods used in the literature were reproduced for
