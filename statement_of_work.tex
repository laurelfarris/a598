\subsection*{Topic}
The topic of this course will be Coronal Seismology. This is rather
broad, which should help
to put my previous research into context, as well as reveal other
possible thesis topics. The
main areas of coronal seismology to be addressed throughout the
semester are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Kink oscillations
    \item Sausage oscillations
    \item Acoustic oscillations
    \item Propagating acoustic waves
    \item Propagating fast waves
    \item Torsional modes
    \item Mixed modes
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Coursework}
The four points of emphasis as laid out by the syllabus for ASTR 598,
along with the portion
of allotted time to be spent on them are addressed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{30\% Literature review capabilities:}
        This will be the main component of the course.
        I will read at least one review article each week. I will
        continuously update the writeup,
        and possibly the presentation (both described below) to
        develop this habit permanently.
    \item \textbf{30\% Scientific writing skills:}
        I will complete a writeup, aastex style, describing the background
        information from the literature, general relevance to
        science/astronomy, possible projects,
        and how the research I have done so far ties into the main topic
        of coronal seismology.
    \item \textbf{30\% Scientific presentation skills:}
        The results of this course will be presented at a pizza lunch
        talk on April 25th at 12:30 pm.
    \item \textbf{10\% Experience with one or more research
        investigation tools:} 
        As most of the work I have done so far has involved data
        analysis, this part will comprise the smallest portion of the
        total workload.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Grading}
The grading scheme for this course will be based on the fraction of
time dedicated to each
of the four tasks listed above (i.e., each portion contributes the
specified percentage to my grade). 100\% completion will be an A,
80\% will be a B, and 60\% will be a C.

\subsection*{Milestones}
We will meet every Thursday at 11am to discuss the assigned reading
for that week, ensure that I am still on track, and make any necessary
changes or additions to the statement of
work. Outside of this meeting, I plan on spending at least eight hours
a week addressing the points listed above. At the time of writing
(2/4/2016) my plan is to read two papers
a week, and add to both the writeup and the presentation. This may be
changed to a two
week block, with the reading taking place one week and the writing
taking place the next. A detailed schedule is including on
the next page (to be revised and adjusted as needed
throughout the semester).
