\section*{A}

\subsection*{acoustic waves (aka sound waves)}
\begin{itemize*}
    \item Longitudinal
    \item Isotropic
    \item Compressible (propagate by means of adiabatic
        compression and decompression)
    \item travel at sound speed (determined by the medium in which
        they were \emph{created}, and maintain this speed even if they
        travel into medium with a different characteristic sound speed).
    \item Important quantities:
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item sound pressure
            \item particle velocity
            \item particle displacement
            \item sound intensity
        \end{itemize*}
    \item exist because of a pressure restoring force: local compression
        (or rarefaction) sets up a \emph{pressure gradient} in opposition
        to the motion
    \item carry energy away from source
    \item large enough amplitude $\rightarrow$ shock wave,
        but usually small; ambient gas slightly disturbed
    \item exist in medium with low or non-existent magnetic field
    \item isotropic \- propagate equally in all directions. The phase
        and group velocities are both equal to the sound speed (hence, the
        part where acoustic waves are sound waves).
\end{itemize*}

\subsection*{Alfv\'en waves}
From presentation slides:

Properties:
\begin{itemize*}
    \item m$=$0 (Axisymmetric, or azimuthally symmetric)
    \item transverse (shear) perturbations
    \item Parallel to $\vec{B}$
    \item Driving force: magnetic tensioin
    \item incompressible
    \item velocity: $v_{A} = \frac{B}{\mu_{o}\rho}$;
        $\sim$ 1000 km s$^{-1}$ in the corona
\end{itemize*}
How to observe:
\begin{itemize*}
    \item Only get Doppler shifts from \emph{long}-period waves
        ($>$ a few minutes).
    \item Measure additional (i.e.\ non-thermal) broadening
        of coronal emission lines; indirect way to observe short-period waves.
    \item Spatial variation in Doppler shift for long periods.
        Gyrosynchrotron emission in radio regime.
\end{itemize*}
Effects of twisting:
\begin{itemize*}
    \item Coupling of various MHD modes
\end{itemize*}
Other:
\begin{itemize*}
    \item \emph{Purely magnetic} and \emph{incompressible} in nature
    \item transverse (perpendicular to $\vec{F}_{res}$)
    \item torsional
    \item incompressible (under conditions of a straight cylinder (not twisted))
    \item type of MHD wave in which ions oscillate in response to a restoring
        force provided by an effective tension on the magentic field lines.
    \item low frequency (compared to the ion cyclotron frequency) traveling
        oscillation of the ion and the magnetic field. The ion mass
        density provides the inertia and the magnetic field line
        tension provides the restoring force.
    \item propagates in the direction of the magnetic field, although waves exist
        at oblique incidence and smoothly change into the magnetosonic wave
        when the propagation is perpendicular to the magnetic field.
    \item The motion of the ions and the perturbation of the magnetic
        field are in the same direction and transverse to the direction of
        propagation. The wave is dispersionless.
    \item If $v_{A} \ll c$, then $v \approx v_{A}$. If $v_{A} \gg c$,
        then $v \approx c$. That is, at high field or low density, the
        velocity of the Alfv\'en wave approaches the speed of light,
        and the Alfv\'en wave becomes an ordinary electromagnetic
        wave.
    \item possibly contribute to ion heating and acceleration in the solar
        wind via ion-cyclotron resonance with $ \nu > 10$ Hz, where R$_m$ is
        very large; small scale structures down to resistive or kinetic scales.
    \item may be generated by tearing or interchange instabilities.
    \item locally supported, phase and group velocities with magnitude equal to
        local Alfv\'en spped, directed along the magnetic field.
    \item weakily dissipative (can propagate long distances, deposit energy
        and momentum far from source).
    \item easily excited by various dynamical perturbations of magnetic field
        lines.
    \item promising tool for heating and diagnositcs of
        coronal magnetic structures.
    \item magnetic force \emph{is} the restoring force$\ldots$ ``snaps'' back
        into a straight line, producing an Alfv\'en wave
    \item velicity is greater than the local sound speed in coronal conditions.
    \item questions/things to look up:
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item how often are they produced? how many?
            \item present in magetnic structures? or everywhere?
            \item three types (shear, torsional, fast magnetoacoustic)?
        \end{itemize*}
    \item Magnetic tension produces transverse waves that propagate
        along the magnetic field $B_{o}$ with speed $v_{A}$:
        $$ v_{A} = \frac{B_o}{\mu\rho_o} $$
    \item (From \emph{Priest}): Types of Alfv\'en waves:
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Shear or Torsional: No accompanying pressure or
            density changes (magnetic field lines are straight?)
            \item Compressional or Fast-Mode: Becomes a fast
            magnetoacoutsic or fast-mode wave when pressure gradients
            are included (Note: these are often the preferred names,
            even when the pressure gradient is unimportant, so as to
            avoid confusion with shear Alfv\'en waves).
        \end{itemize*}

\subsection*{Bessel's equations}

(From Boas p. 587): Bessel functions are damped sines and cosines.
Solutions of differential equations can be represented by power series.
Graphs, formulas; electricty, heat, hydrodynamics, elasticity, wave motion,
quantum$\ldots$, cylindrical symmetry$\ldots$

Bessel's differential equation:
$$ x^2\frac{d^y}{dx2} + x\frac{dy}{dx} + (x^2-p^2)y = 0 $$
where $p$ is the \emph{order} of the Bessel function $y$ and is a constant, and
$y$ is the solution.
$a$ = integer $\rightarrow$ cylindrical,
$a$ = half-integer $\rightarrow$ spherical.
$$ x^2y'' + xy' + (x^2-p^2)y = 0  $$
$$ x(xy') + (x^2-p^2)y' = 0  $$

\section*{D}

\subsection*{dispersion}
Dispersion is when the distinct phase velocities of the components of the
envelope cause the wave packet to ``spread out'' over time.
The components of the wave packet (or envelope) move apart to the degree
where they no longer combine to complete the envelope.

Causes different components of the wave to have different phase velocities.

Different kinds of dispersion:
\begin{itemize*}
    \item Normal dispersion: strictly increasing Re $\epsilon(\omega)$ with
        increasing $\omega$.
    \item Anomalous dispersion: decreasing Re $\epsilon(\omega)$ with
        increasing $\omega$.
    \item Resonant absorption: occurs in regions where Im $\epsilon(\omega)$
        is large.
\end{itemize*}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=5in]{disp.png}
\end{figure}

No dispersion: $v_{ph} = v_{gr}$; dispersion: $v_{ph} \neq v_{gr}$.
A medium that is free from dispersion has index of refraction that is constant
as a function of frequency, so all wavelengths are similarly affected.
Permittivity and permeability are functions of frequency.
Non-dispersive waves have phase speed ($v_{ph}$, speed that wave actually travels
through medium?) independent of wavenumber, $k$.
All waves of \emph{any} $k$ propagate at the same speed.
Uniform dissipation, resonant mode conversion, physical mechanisms vs. ?

Dispersion \emph{relation}:
\begin{itemize*}
    \item Relates the wavelength (or wavenumber) of a wave to its
        frequency.
    \item Describe the effect of dispersion in a medium on the properties
        of a wave traveling through that medium.
\end{itemize*}

\section*{\textcolor{magenta}{G}}

\subsection*{global modes}
\begin{itemize*}
    \item $y(x,t)$ governed by some PDE with no \emph{explicit} time dependence.
    \item A global mode is a solution of the form
        $y(x,t) = \hat{y}(x)e^{i\omega t}$
    \item PDE-dynamical system of infinitely many equations coupled together.
\end{itemize*}

\subsection*{gravity waves}
Generated in fluid medium or interface between two media when the
force of gravity or buoyency tries to restore equilibrium
e.g.\ ``wind waves'' from between atmosphere and ocean.
P-modes are global acoustic oscillations.
(Note: \emph{gravitational} waves are not the same thing; they
have something to do with relativity).

\subsection*{kink modes/waves/oscillations/instabilities}
A kink instability is a class of MHD instabilities which sometimes develop
in a thin plasma column (e.g.\ coronal loop) carrying a strong axial current.
If a ``kink'' begins to develop in a column, the magnetic forces
on the inside of the kink become larger than those on the outside,
which leads to growth of the perturbation. As it develops at fixed
areas in the plasma, kinks belong to the class of ``absolute plasma
instabilities'', as opposed to convective processes, and are guided by
field-aligned non-uniformities of the fast magnetoacoustic speed.
They cause the displacement of the axis of said
structure.

Fast kink waves:
\begin{itemize*}
    \item transverse (general property of fast waves)
    \item $c_k = \sqrt{\frac{\rho_oV^2_{Ao}+\rho_eV^2_{Ae}}
        {\rho_o+\rho_e}} \approx V_A\sqrt{\frac{2}{1+\frac{\rho_e}{\rho_o}}} $
        in the low-$\beta$ plasma.
    %\item $v_{ph} = \frac{\omega}{k} \approx C_k \gtrsim V_A $
    \item Period $P=\frac{2l}{V_A}\sqrt{\frac{1+\rho_e/\rho_o}{2}}$
        where $\lambda=2l$ ($l$ is the loop length).
        Typically, $l \approx 60-600$ Mm in the corona.
    \item ``current pinch'' instability
    \item Important observation from which magnetic field strength
        can be derived.
    \item Period $P=\frac{2l}{V_A}\sqrt{\frac{1+\rho_e/\rho_o}{2}}$
        where $\lambda=2l$ ($l$ is the loop length).
        Typically, $l \approx 60-600$ Mm in the corona.
    \item ``current pinch'' instability
    \item Important observation from which magnetic field strength
        can be derived.
    \item slab: phase speed = V$_{A_e}$
    \item tube: kink speed:
        $$ c_K = \frac{B_i^2 + B_e^2}{\sqrt{\mu(\rho_i+\rho_e)}} $$
        (mean Alfv\'enic speed).
        Slab (or tube) is moved laterally; little variation in cross-sec,
        density, or intensity.
\end{itemize*}
Standing and propagating both rapidly damped.


Slow kink waves:
\begin{itemize*}
    \item longitudinal (velocity directed along magnetic field)
    \item compressible (variations in density and intensity)
\end{itemize*}

Other (or simply unorganized):
\begin{itemize*}
    \item oblique (inclined with respect to the flow direction)
    \item \emph{weakly compressible}, but could nevertheless be
        observed with imaging instruments as \emph{periodic standing}
        or \emph{propagating} displacements of coronal structures, e.g.\ coronal loops.
        The frequency of transverse or ``kink'' modes is given by the following expression:
            $$ w_K = \sqrt{ \frac{2k_zB^2}{\mu(\rho_i+\rho_e)}  }   $$
        In a cylindrical model of a loop,
        the parameter \emph{azimuthal wave number},
        m, is equal to 1 for kink modes.
    \item In the long wavelength limit, the phase speed of all but
        sausage fast modes tends to the so-called kink speed,
        which corresponds to the density weighed average Alfv\'en speed.
    \item Two instabilities of axisymmetric, current-carrying plasmas
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item sawtooth relaxations
            \item fishbone oscillations
        \end{itemize*}
        associated with instability of internal kink modes
    \item Both standing and propagating, T = $\sim$ seconds-minutes.
    \item lowest spatial harmonics along field; global (fundametnal)
        modes of coronal loops nodes of displacement at footpoints,
        maximum at apex.
    \item Period of global kink mode determined by double the loop length,
        L, divided by the kink speed, c$_K$.
\end{itemize*}


\section*{\textcolor{magenta}{L}}

\subsection*{leaky modes}
\begin{itemize*}
    \item Waves are allowed to radiate into the external medium,
        i.e.\ the condition of mode localization is relaxed.
    \item complex eigenfrequencies
    \item Bessel functions are replaced by Hankel functions in the
        dispersion relation. Can be the fundamental harmonic.
    \item Wavenumbers below cutoff value?
    \item Has electric field that decays monotonically for a finite
        distance in the transverse direction but becomes oscillatory
        everywhere beyond that finite distance.
    \item Mode ``leaks'' out of
        the waveguide as it travels down it, producing attenuation.
    \item Relative amplitude of oscillatory part (leakage rate)
        must be sufficiently small that the mode maintains its
        shape as it decays, in order to be called a mode at all.
\end{itemize*}

\subsection*{longitudinal waves}
waves in which the displacement of the \emph{medium} is in the
same direction as, or the opposite direction to,
the direction of travel of the wave.

\section*{\textcolor{magenta}{M}}
\subsection*{magnetoacoustic waves}
\begin{itemize*}
    \item A magnetosonic wave (also magnetoacoustic wave) is a
        longitudinal wave of ions (and electrons) in a magnetized
        plasma propagating perpendicular to the stationary magnetic field.
    \item compressible
    \item slow MHD wave
    \item collectively supported by the plasma environment, i.e., the wave mode acts
        across neighbouring magnetic field lines and across transverse
        plasma inhomogeneities.
    \item observed as distrubances of EUV (and possibly X-ray) emission

            \item resonantly interact with the closed waveguide
            \item devolop non-linearly (e.g.\ solitons or shock waves
                can form)
        \end{itemize*}
    \item Inhomogeneous and magnetized plasma has two particular
        \emph{dissipation} mechanisms of MHD waves:
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item Resonant absorption
            \item Phase mixing
        \end{itemize*}
    \item Theoretical modeling:
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item dispersion relations
            \item evolutionary equations
        \end{itemize*}
    \item Theoretical foundation:

            \item dispersion reslatiosn of MHD modes of a plasma cylinder
            \item models: loops, prominence fibrils, plumes, various filaments
            \item evolutionary equations
        \end{itemize*}
    \item Considerations of observed waves:
        \begin{itemize*}
            \item geometry: simple (slab or tube)? or more complex?
            \item mode
                \begin{itemize*}
                    \item longitudinal vs.\ transverse
                    \item compressible vs.\ incompressible
                    \item oscillating vs.\ propagating

            \item corona: compare obs and theory to discover new things
        \end{itemize*}
    \item \textcolor{red}{Interpreting observations: distinguish between modes that are
        pressure driven (acoustic/slow magnetoacoustic) and magnetically
        driven (Alfv\'en)}
    \item \textcolor{red}{Relations between the (internal and external)

        is governed by  the following system of first order differential

    \item Modes:

        \end{itemize*}
\end{itemize*}


\subsection*{modes}
A wave may be a superposition of lots of other waves. Each of those
waves is a ``mode'' of the resultant wave (think of the foundation
of Fourier Analysis: sums of sines and cosines).

\section*{S}

\subsection*{sausage modes}
%Trapped fast modes supported by thick, dense loops because of the cutoff
%wavenumber (pfw_2). Observe spatially resolved radio (see sources in
%pfw_2).
\begin{itemize*}
    \item m = 0
    \item The fast magnetoacoustic sausage mode is another type of
        localized, modified fast magnetoacoustic wave.
    \item Mainly transverse.
    \item Standing fast sausage modes have symmetric tube modes
    \item Has a long-wavelength cutoff (trapped sausage modes do
        not exist at longer wavelengths).
        Approaches a cut-off at the external Alfv\'en speed.
        (Under condition of \emph{mode localization})
    \item Main feature is the periodic fluctuation of the cross-sectional
        area of the waveguide. This change is also associated with
        periodic fluctuations in density and temperature within the
        waveguide.
    \item Distinct sign of sausage oscillations is when periodic

        180$^{\circ}$ out of phase $\rightarrow$ strong signal.
        (Less distinct signal is when periodicities in pore size
        don't match any intensity variations).
    \item Produce perturbations in density and magnetic field strength,
        and the corresponding plasma motions cause pulsations in the
        tube cross-section.
    \item Associated with perturbations of the loop cross-section
        and plasma concentration.
    \item Perturbations of plasma in the radial direction are stronger
        than perturbations along the field.
    \item Mode conversion and absorption through Alfv\'en resonance
        cannot take place (slow resonance can still operate).

Standing oscillations vs.\ propagating waves
\begin{itemize}
    \item In loops, propagating waves damp before
        reaching opposite footpoint.
    \item Velocity and intensity are 90$^{\circ}$ out of phase
        for standing oscillations, and are in phase for propagating
        acoustic waves.
    \item Frequencies less than the cutoff are standing oscillations,
        waves with frequency greater than the cutoff propagate into
        the chromosphere.
    \item no loop shape change or displacement
    \item near footpoints.

\subsection*{torsional vibration}
\begin{itemize*}
    \item angular vibration of an object $\sim$ shaft along the
        axis of vibration
\end{itemize*}

\subsection*{transverse waves}
\textcolor{magenta}{(from wikipedia:)}
moving waves that \emph{consist} of oscillations occurring perpendicular
to the direction of energy transfer.
If a \emph{transverse} wave is moving in the positive x-direction,
its \emph{oscillations} are in up and down directions that lie in the y–z plane.
Light is an example of a transverse wave.
($\vec B$ and $\vec E$ oscillate in directions perpendicular to the direction
in which the light is actually traveling).
With regard to transverse waves in matter,
the \emph{displacement of the medium} is perpendicular to the
direction of propagation of the wave.
Examples: A ripple in a pond and a wave on a string.

\subsection*{trapped modes}
For a specified geometry, uniqueness of the solution to a forcing problem
at a particular frequency is equivalent to the non-existence of a trapped
mode at that frequency. A trapped mode is a solution of the corresponding
homogeneous problem and represents a free oscillation with finite energy
of the fluid surrounding the fixed structure. For a given structure,
trapped modes may exist only at discrete frequencies.
Mathematically, a trapped mode corresponds to an eigenvalue embedded
in the continuous spectrum of the relevant operator.

\subsection*{tube speed}
Also known as \emph{cusp speed}, the tube speed is the combination of sound
and Alfv\'en speeds.
$$ C_T = C_sC_A/(C_A^2 + C_s^2)^{1/2} $$
